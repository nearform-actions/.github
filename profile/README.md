# Nearform
## Building enduring impact_ 

### Who are we? 

*​​We combine digital engineering, design and strategy to build code and capability for sustained business impact.*

:computer: We’re thinkers, doers and makers. We build digital products that make the world work better by creating great customer, business and developer experiences. Our approach empowers teams to continue building digital strength with confidence. 

### Our contributions to the Open Source community

:busts_in_silhouette: Open Source is our craft and community — a global network of people passionate about pooling ideas and sharing the spirit of innovation to push programming forward. We harness the power of Open Source to pursue technological excellence for ourselves and business advantage for our clients.

As part of our day-to-day activities, we contribute to Open Source, conduct research and create prototypes, and regularly publish Open Source code which we also use internally.

### Nearform Actions

As part of our contribution to Open Source work, we developed Github Actions for anyone to use. This organisation is an extension of that philosophy.
